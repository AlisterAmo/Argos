hydra [if you have not hydra installed or is an older version]

untar and cd hydra-7.4.2
configure, make and make install as usual, solving the minimum dependences if needed: 
openssl idn libpcre libssh 
at this time we only need http support but future modules could use ssh. the more protocols supported by hydra, the better
once compiled, if you want to run argos from cron tasks, you'd better copy or symlink /usr/localb/bin/hydra to argos/src/bin/hydra
