## CONFIG ESPECIFICA DE ESTA MARCA/MODELO DE CAMARA
MODULENAME='Dlink'
FINGERPRINT='realm=DCS-'
HYDRA_URL='/'
SNAPSHOT_URL='/dms' 
# too late, but I noticed that the snapshot url should be diferent for 3 or 4 different models that match this fingerprint
# in fact, there are some cameras that even have no available internal script for getting jpg captures.
# the only solution is a lot of time researching and developing some subsets of this module, which is smthg I cannot invest time into
# so snapshotting will fail 80% of time. sorry!
