# file creation mask setting
# if you plan to run install argos in a system-wide location and run it as root,

#DEBUG=1
EMAILREPORTS='root@localhost' 
# argos primarily uses internal unix mail to report scan logs in a delayed manner
# you can set a dummy account here if you don't want to receive emails from argos,
# but please note that then you will be strictly forced to use argos in 
# interfactive terminals only, or reading the log generated in the logs folder
# if you set external email addresses here, you MUST cofigure exim4 server to allow relay
